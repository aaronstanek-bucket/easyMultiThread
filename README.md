I found myself creating different multithreading routines for every program. This was less than optimal, so I created one algorithim to rule them all.

Feel free to use for whatever free of charge, no need to mention me as the author.

Enjoy!

P.S. It probably has bugs that I havn't tested for. DO NOT ASSUME THAT IT FUNCTIONS FOR ALL CASES.
